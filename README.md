This project uses a logistic regression model to predict the presence of heart disease based on medical data. The dataset includes features like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular indicators. Key steps in the code:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loads and inspects the heart disease dataset, checking for missing values and normalizing features.
Model Training: Splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a logistic regression model on the training data.
Evaluation: Calculates accuracy scores for both training and test datasets.
Prediction System: Accepts user input to predict the likelihood of heart disease in new cases based on input values for relevant health metrics.
